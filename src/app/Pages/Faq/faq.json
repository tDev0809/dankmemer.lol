If you do pls enable list and you see an “enabled guild wide” (guild means server by the way) or the command is enabled for a certain channel that means it’s an override, because enables override disables. You can do pls enable remove 4 for example and it will remove number 4 off of the enable list. You can also do pls enable clear and everything on the enable list will be reset. (The same goes for the disable list if you’re looking to clear it or remove something off the list for that)"

You can’t have a lifesaver in your inventory when you have the quest active and die because then it won’t count and it won’t get completed. Be sure of those things."
