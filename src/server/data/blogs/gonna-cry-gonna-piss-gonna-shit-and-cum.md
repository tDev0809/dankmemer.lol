**This month we see a lot of changes that some people will love. At the same time, some people will hate what we’ve done. I’m here to show you what has been changed, and convince you that it’s a great change.**

## New/Updated/Fixed Commands
Here are some of the new commands we’ve added to the bot with this update!

### Image Category
Two major updates ago, we removed almost 25 image commands from the bot. We have added those back. You can use dab, magik, and almost 20 more again! Not only this, but all these commands are much much faster than before!

### Memey Category
We moved a lot of the “fun” commands into this category, because we felt that memey should also stand for jokes. The thing you’ll be most excited about is that we’ve improved most of these commands internally, and they should post almost 80000% faster than before. That’s not an exaggeration, that’s a fact. Aetheryx doesn’t work on updates often but when he does, he goes big. Thanks Aetheryx.

### Sound Category
This is a good one… Kromatic worked very hard on the previous sfx commands, and you’re going to love the new system. You can upload and play your own custom sound effects. They’re per person, and you can have 3 at any given time. There are some details about what types of files you can upload and how long they can be, but you can figure that all out by using the commands: `pls addclip, playclip, listclip, deleteclip`

### Moderation Category
Many of you may have noticed that there was a moderation category with only one command for a while. Well now we’ve expanded it. We’ve added basic kick/ban/clean functionality, as well as a basic and optional modlog. We also may have expanded on the randomkick command, with a randomban command.

### NSFW Category
Good news for people who use this bot for only porn. I’ve added 9 new NSFW commands. They are more niche than some of the others, but you’ll like them none the less. On another note, be sure to go [vote for Dank Memer](https://discordbots.org/bot/memes/vote) otherwise you may not be able to use some of your favorite NSFW commands.

### Fun Category
We’ve moved a lot of these commands to the memey category, but also we’ve added something you’ve been wanting for a while. A gif search tool with gify, because for some reason you don’t like discord’s built in integration. We’ve also added `pls hack, penis, format, candle`

### Utility Category
This is a “new” category, and going to be getting a lot of updates in the next few weeks. I love some good utilities, so instead of pls stats and other kinda lame utility commands, there are some actually useful ones. Go see for yourself what they all are, and you can expect 5–15 new ones by the end of the month! Another thing,

### Animal Category
For our newest addition to the animal category, we’ve added foxes. They’re cute and awesome. Soon you will see a few more animals pop up as well!

### Text Category
I’m not sure why we haven’t had this, but we do now. A l33t command. l33tify your text and be the lamest cat in school! Also there’s an eleet command now, and it’s weird.

### Info Category
The info category is now basically what the old utility category is. This will later include user statistics on bot usage! Also, the stats command is easier for people to read, and there is a “debug” command for more in depth stats. Also also, the help command has been updated again. Check it out, it’s pretty unique!

### Config Category
Another new category that has some old “utility” commands in it, the command to set a modlog, and will be getting some new server configuration tools soon!

### Currency Category
Currency has a few new commands such as upgrades, multiplier, trivia, and inventory. You can read more about the new currency changes in the next section below.

## Currency Changes
This month the main focus has been changing the currency system, it really needed all these changes and it wasn’t optional to us.

### Balances have been wiped.
This will be the part that no one likes. Some of you spent countless hours grinding out currency to make it to the top, but this had to be done. We never planned on currency being as popular as it turned out to be, so we very poorly planned for it. Some commands were OP, some were broken and exploitable, and that’s our bad.


![](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/486641139034619924/568611613775495198/11gFbJUMnxmVvERGa7tLG5Q.png)  
The only way to save the currency at this point was to wipe it. People were never meant to have trillions of coins, let alone numbers that the bot couldn’t even handle.

While we see how this can be fun to play with, it severely limits what we’re able to do in the future as far as new commands and new features (like a shop).

### There is a shop to spend coins on the way.
Here is where it becomes worth the wipe. We are adding a shop for you to buy pointless things on. As of right now there are 3 items in the shop, as well as 4 upgrades you can buy to help you with currency commands. Currently the items have no affect on anything, but eventually they will allow you to do various actions that users without those items can’t. The upgrades are fully functional. The multiplier upgrade allows you to earn more coins in gambling, the vault upgrade allows you to hold more coins in the bank, the share upgrade allows you to transfer more coins at once to other players, the luck upgrade increases your chances of winning bets and other luck based commands. Within the next week or so, we’ll update the bot again so you can see and buy these all with the “pls shop” command.

### We’ve decreased the value of a meme coin by a lot.
The value of the meme coin became more and more inflated as time went on, so we’ve changed all values on the commands and lowered that by a ton. So when you only get 25 coins from a daily command, don’t be surprised! You’ll soon learn that those 25 coins are very valuable and a lot less expendable than before. When you lose a gamble, we want it to hurt. When you successfully steal from someone, we want you to feel like the greatest in the world. Now you do.

### We’ve added bank accounts.
People’s biggest complaints with the old currency system, is that they couldn’t opt-out of being stolen from. Well, we still don’t think that’s a good idea. So we have a middle ground for you, you now have a bank account that is not able to be stolen from. However, there is a cap to how much your account can hold. The easiest and most direct way to upgrade that storage will be to purchase upgrades for it once the shop is released. However, you also slowly earn more vault space by just using the bot over time.

### We’ve finally added multipliers.
For months, only donors have gotten a multiplier. Now everyone has the chance to get them, and even better, some are secret. If you use the multiplier command, it will show what you have unlocked, and how many you still need to unlock. As a hint, I’ll say that most are conditional based on various factors that you can change.

### Previous errors are now fixed.
You should no longer get errors from the leaderboards and inventory commands. These were caused by having too many coins, but that isn’t an issue anymore after the wipe. Keep in mind, new problems may arise as we add new features and change values, but we will fix them as soon as we can!

## Donor Updates
I’ve changed stuff around for donors a bit

### New Patreon tier
There is now a $50 tier for those people who have too much money to spend. With it, you get a TSHIRT!! Those are still being designed, and will not be sent out for the first time until August, but you can “pre-order” now!

### No more PayPal
Because of many many people charging back their PayPal donations, it is no longer being accepted for donor perks. However soon, there will be an option to buy meme coins via paypal on our website. Stay tuned for that

### Premium Bot
Wowza premium bot is outdated. The next thing I’m working on is all new commands for it. It’s currently offline because the currency commands don’t work with the new currency, but it will be online again within a week. Also once it’s back, the days of it needing to be added by Melmsie are over. You will be able to add it yourself, and have a Dank Memer staff member just send and activation code to activate it on your server.

### Premium Server
Donors now have the option to join our Premium Server. Message Melmsie or another staff member for an invite! It’s a smaller version of Dank Memer’s server, all about hanging out and having fun!

## That’s all folks
This update has a lot, and I’m sure it’s not what you all were expecting. But in the next month, Dank Memer will be at it’s strongest ever. If you have any feedback or concerns, join our support server and talk to some staff members!
