The year is over. Let's reflect a bit and then look forward to the upcoming year.

## 2020
This year has been MASSIVE for us at Dank Memer. Our average daily server growth has grown nearly 5x. At the start of the year, we would grow about 2,000 servers a day. In the end, we're averaging about 10,000 servers a day.

This growth is thanks to all of you, choosing to spend your quarantine time using our bot. You've shared the bot with your friends, and they've shared it with their friends. Thank you.

### Charitable giving
In 2020, we raised **$72,693**.  $53,193 went to [St. Jude's Children's Hospital](https://www.stjude.org/) to help pay for patient treatments and research. $10,000 went to [Black Lives Matter (BLM)](https://blacklivesmatter.com/) to help fight racial inequality in America. $5,000 went to the [American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)](https://www.aclu.org/) to help pay for court battles over people's rights. And finally, $1,500 went to various Australian charities to help fight the Australian bush fires.

This charitable money was provided through purchases made from YOU guys through our [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/dankmemerbot) and [lootboxes](https://dankmemer.lol/loot). 

## 2021
Next year has the potential to be great. It'll be what we decide, as a community, to make it.

We've already, in previous blogs, listed upcoming features. We won't go over that again, [but I highly suggest reading up.](https://dankmemer.lol/blogs/plans-past-2020)

This year is going to be great. Besides development work, I have many community events planned both inside and outside the [Dank Memer Community Server](https://discord.gg/memers).

Also, we're choosing a large variety of new partner servers in the next week. There will be a `pls partners` command listing their servers and a place on our website listing them coming soon.

## In Conclusion
I don't have a ton to say for this blog. I'm sitting here finishing this up while I wait for a few game updates to install to spend the last of my 2020 playing games with family and friends. Tarkov, Destiny 2, and Stardew valley will be where I'm spending the final hours of 2020. How about you?

My thoughts go out to all those sick, or worse, with COVID-19. Memes aside, it's been pretty rough for a lot of people. Wear your damn masks, and here's hoping to 2021 bringing a lot more memes than screams.

Good luck out there,
Melmsie
