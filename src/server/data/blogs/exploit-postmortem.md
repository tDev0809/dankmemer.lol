## Here's the tea sis

A bug was found that let people spam certain commands that basically caused coin duplication. A large server of people did this together which generated a massive amount of coins that didn't exist in the currency before that. This is a classic case of inflation. Once those people were filthy rich, they started doing three things:
1. They started getting stolen from, so the "fake" money spread.
2. They started sharing coins, so the "Fake" money spread more.
3. They shared HOW they got those coins, so the bug spread even more.  

By the time the devs were alerted to the issue, the two with the power to stop or fix this were both away so it went on for multiple hours.

## Is it fixed?

We are unable to reproduce the bug anymore, so we're fairly confident that it's fixed right now. That being said, there's still a lot of cheaters we didn't find, we're still working on that. *COUGH* https://i.imgur.com/JaZt3Xw.png

## How many users got banned?

We blacklisted OR/AND wiped over 1000 people. A majority of these people were clear cheaters. In the off case you got blacklisted and DIDN'T abuse the bug, but stole from someone who did or got given coins, here's a form to appeal that: https://forms.gle/FJoRof6mu1MAdv1s6  

In order to get unblacklisted AND/OR get your items/money back, you'll have to provide clear evidence that you didn't cheat. If that's not possible, we're sorry but we won't be restoring anything at this time. As per our rules have always said, abusing exploits is bannable. Participating in exploits falls into the same line.
