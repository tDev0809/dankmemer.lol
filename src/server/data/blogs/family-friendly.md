We're happy to introduce our first iteration of a "family-friendly mode."

For a long time, we've been telling users we had no plans for this, as Dank Memer is inherently a bot not meant for children. While we still maintain this to be accurate, this should allow people to use the bot at work and home without the fear of someone looking over your shoulder and seeing not safe for work content.

This mode is not perfect and will be vastly improved in our upcoming rewrite of the bot. However, for now, it does the job.

It takes any bot output and filters it against a fairly strict list of "curse words". If there is one, it just replaces it with "BAD-WORD." Also, it completely hides the NSFW category from the help command, along with disabling it from being able to be used. Borderline NSFW objects, such as the "pink phallic object," is completely hidden from the currency system. If you have them, it won't show up in your inventory. You can't send them, and you can't use them. It's hidden from the shop as well.

We may have missed some features or words on the bot that should be hidden on the bot, please make sure you report it to our support staff, and we'll get it fixed ASAP.

To enable this for yourself, run `pls settings familyfriendly true`. To enable this for your server, run `pls serverconf familyfriendly true`. Yes, we added it for both servers AND specific user settings.

I hope this feature lands nicely on your servers that are afraid to use Dank Memer for this type of content, and we'll be able to cater to more people with this and future updates.

Thanks, Melmsie
