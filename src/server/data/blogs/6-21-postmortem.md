## Here's the tea sis

We tried almost 2 weeks ago to update the bot with a sick moderation update. It failed horribly and we worked on fixing it.

Today we tried updating that again, with (what we thought) was a major improvement over the last time.

It crashed and burned, and we realized we're in too much technical debt to update right now. What this means is we're going to rewrite the entire bot (backend only, don't worry) before we work on any more content updates. Should this go well and quickly, we should be able to spend a lot less time fixing bugs and failing updates, and a lot more time bringing new content and features to you all.

We're VERY sorry this has gone down this way, we're honestly embarrased about this. We're almost at 1 million servers, but we don't feel we're at 1m server quality yet. So our goal is to rewrite the bot in the best way we possibly can to ensure stability and ease of use while writing future updates for your content.

Again, I'M sorry. We'll do better, you can count on us like you have for the last two years.

We love and appreciate you all
