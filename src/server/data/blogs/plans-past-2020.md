As we reach a milestone of 4,000,000 servers having the bot added, I figured it could be fun to talk about our long term plans.

We've talked in great detail about the upcoming total bot rewrite, but we haven't talked much about what's coming AFTER that. That will be the topic of this blog post.

### Immediately after the rewrite
We plan on starting right into a web dashboard for the bot. It won't be just any dashboard, but one where you can essentially use the currency system without even being on Discord. See shop items, customize profiles, take care of pets, manage skills, gawk at leaderboards, control the bot, and much more.

We'll also be trying to transition away from our current monetization practices to something more sustainable long term in addition to all this great functionality. We plan to add a way to get monthly premium perks straight from our website and put less of a focus on loot boxes in favor of something more passive such as non-intrusive ads on the commands page.

### Expanding Currency Features
We will be using the upcoming [slash commands and improved Discord UI](https://blog.discord.com/the-future-of-bots-on-discord-4e6e050ab52e) to enhance how you interact with the bot's currency systems. Those changes will also come hand in hand with an update around the same time, which adds MUCH more customization to the game with skills, custom profile banners, custom pet images, and so much more.

### Expanding Past Discord
Once we are happy with our dashboard and currency system again, we will start experimenting with even more ways to interact with the bot. Purely hopeful thinking at this stage, but it would be dope to have other platforms for our product. Phone apps, twitch chats, slack chats, and whatever other platforms are exploding at the time.

### New Bots/Products
We will be supporting Dank Memer for years to come. We will stick around as long as users want us still. However, we will eventually start working on new products altogether, with the same spirit you've come to know and love with Dank Memer. A memey currency bot is not our ceiling, merely a platform to climb upwards.

### Hiring New Developers
Once the time comes to expand, and if financials are still doing well, we plan on hiring more developers to help us more quickly bring new features to you. This likely isn't going to happen soon, as the circumstances with us being in the middle of a rewrite make it much more complicated to hire someone. Besides, we have to find the right candidates with enough experience to contribute and the attitude we're looking for in co-workers, which isn't always easy on Discord. More on this big step will come probably mid next year.

### Expanding Support
With our large user-base and in-depth features comes many people asking for help with things that require more than just an FAQ. Discord is a problematic place to offer support when talking about tens of thousands of people a week visiting with their various questions and issues. We plan on expanding past Discord, and soon, we will be offering email and live chat supportâ€”more on this early next year.

Thank you for sticking with us all these years and helping us grow to be the 4th largest bot on Discord, at 4,000,000 servers strong. We're excited about the future, and I hope you are too.
