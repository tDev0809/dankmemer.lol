## Plans for the next major update
We've been thinking long and hard about what aspects of the bot could really use improved, and we've decided the next category to get an overhaul would be **moderation**.
We're going full out, advanced logging, timed punishments, and much much more. This will be out this summer, and we hope you'll all find it useful!

## Plans for the next minor update
As always, we want to fix bugs, and that will be a priotity.
On top of that, we may possibly be adding some smaller commands (fishing?) for currency, as well as tweaking some values.

For music, we plan on adding a "recommendation" system, to recommend music you may enjoy. And more exciting than that, we should have lyrics support coming soon!

For the final news of this update, soon the "pink phallic object" will be removed from the store, and will now be considered "retired". Buy them while you still can!
