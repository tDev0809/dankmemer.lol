We believe Dank Memer is the best multipurpose bot on Discord, and here's why.
### What is a multipurpose bot?
A multipurpose bot is one that you add to your server for more than just one base set of functions. Dank Memer is a multipurpose bot, as we do music, moderation, memes, currency, etc. An example of a non-multipurpose bot would be something like Rythm, who JUST does music.

Many people see multipurpose bots as bad or annoying, but we believe that's a small brain way to look at it. Multipurpose bots are awesome, especially if they take the time to make each of their major functions as usable and unique as possible! And that's exactly what we do for Dank Memer.

### How is Dank Memer different?
Yes, we are a multipurpose bot. We do many many many things, but we take pride in doing them all REALLY well! If we feel a certain category isn't performing well or being enjoyed, we spend time making sure to beef it up as per user requested features and our own ideas.

What we REALLY excel at however, is doing what every other bot is doing, but in a MEMEY way. For instance, instead of saying "this user was banned", we say stuff like "good riddance idiot". Almost every aspect of our bot is memey at heart, and we think that adds a really deep enjoyment factor to using our stuff.

### What makes Dank Memer better?
Plain and simply, we're devoted and we listen. We spend a ton of time making our bot the best it can be, and we're one of very few bots that really takes in user suggestions for improvements and additions. We believe this is a very large reason we are on as many servers as we are (over 1 million). Lots of developers decide they know whats best, and don't really care what the user has to say. We don't, we work together with our community to decide the best way forward for everyone.

### How is Dank Memer adapting?
As other bots pop up, mimicking our functions or doing them better than us, we track what users want. Your feedback is invaluable, and we are constantly talking about what to implement or improve next. We are adapting to be even more multipurpose, without being overwhelming.

As new technology comes out, we experiment with it to make sure our back-end is as fast and efficient as possible. This also includes when Discord adds new things. We were one of the first bots to implement slowmode support, and we always keep our eyes on the horizon looking for more ways to closely integrate with Discord!

### Dank Memer is constantly being updated
We have a team of 4 developers working daily to get the next content/updates out to you. Even if you don't see an update for a month, that's because we're putting all our time and effort into making sure it's exactly what you want, with as few bugs as possible.

### Dank Memer is secure
We log virtually no data unless it's specifically for bug hunting, and even then we don't log who commands are ran by so we can protect your privacy. All the data we do store (think your personal user database) is stuff that's imperative to using our bot, and always serves a real function for the bot and yourself. We will never sell your data, leak your data, or in any way endanger your right to be a private citizen. 

We know security is a touchy subject, but TLDR; We've got your back.

### What's next?
Monday, July 22 there will be a developer livestream on our [twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/dankmemerdiscord) talking about some very exciting changes coming to currency soon! Be sure to be there, as after the announcement we'll be taking any q/a you have + maybe a giveaway!
