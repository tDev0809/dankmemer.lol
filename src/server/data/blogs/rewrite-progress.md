It's been a few months since we last gave any information into the state of the bot's complete back-end rewrite, so while I'm sitting on a flight, I figured I'd write up something of a progress update.

At this point in time, we're still in the stage of just writing code. We have a little that might be up on beta soon for testing, but it's not even close to the complete command suite, primarily missing the more complicated things like the currency system and mini-games.

We are absolutely on track to have this finished before the end of the year. You might wonder why it's taking so long, however.

We aren't just fixing bugs or improving our back-end systems, we're entirely rewriting them from scratch. By doing this, we're reducing bloat and development time for future features while simultaneously raising the bot's uptime and availability overall.

There would be less than 2% of code re-used from the current version in the rewrite if I had to guess. This also means we will be fixing all the bugs reported in the last few months, as it's an entirely new codebase. This also allows us to finally add long-requested features, such as running commands in direct messages with the bot or having language settings.

As you may know from my last blog post, I've been on vacation a large portion of the previous month, but I'm back now. That doesn't mean the rewrite has been on hold for a month; however, Aetheryx has been working hard behind the scenes to get the back-end systems ready.

Next, we're going to be meeting to decide on final specs for the currency system changes before we start writing it all. Over the next few months, we'll begin releasing blog posts detailing upcoming changes you can look forward to.

TLDR; We're still working on it, it's coming along, and it's going to be pretty fantastic.
