We have updated our rules for using Dank Memer. Some changes are subtle changes to the wording to clear things up, and some are very different or even removed.

Please visit our [rules page](https://dankmemer.lol/rules) and see for yourself what has changed before reading this.

In this blog post, we'll go over what was changed and why.

### Alternate Accounts
For nearly three years now, we've been battling with alt usage. We believe using an alt gives an unfair advantage to players who choose to do so and that alt usage is not using our bot as intended.

We've been banning any alts reported or found by our staff, depending on the severity, banning or blacklisting the main accounts. This rule made up most of the manual punishments by our bot mods, and we had CONSTANT reports.

While we STILL believe alts are the WRONG way to play with our bot, we are, for now, not going to be taking action against them. This rule may come back in the future, so please do not hear this change as an "alts are great now!" message.

After all the initial appeals come through, this rule change will give our bot mods a much smaller workload daily.

Steps to prevent alt usage within the bot, such as limits on sharing/gifting, will still exist.

### Etiquette
Due to malicious rumors started this year about the bot, dank memer based servers starting drama over the bot, and other community-based problems, we will now begin to ban users for causing this type of drama.

We want our community to be an accepting and friendly place, and we won't allow you to use the bot if you try and break that.

### Real Money Trading
Real money trading (RMT) has always been against the rules, but we've made it more evident what this entails. RMT has always been an issue on a small scale, but we don't want anyone to think something is acceptable when it's not (such as nitro for bot coins/items).

### Giveaway Requirements or Bot Usage Requirements in Your Server
Our support staff gets almost hourly questions such as "is this fine for a giveaway requirement?". Often about leveling bots such as Amari, or locking giveaways behind boosters. This rule should clear the air on this issue. Bot usage or bot giveaways should not be locked behind any form of a paywall, with the small exception of a booster requirement.

We are allowing boost requirements because it's a natural part of running a discord server, and we know servers want more reasons to win over potential boosters, and we can get behind that.

## Appealing bans/blacklists for changed rules
If you are BANNED (permanent, your data is gone), you do not need to appeal. We are doing our yearly wipe of all bans later this month. You will be unbanned shortly after that.

If you are BLACKLISTED for a rule that has changed or was removed, you can feel free to [appeal that](https://dankmemer.lol/appeals). Please mention what you were banned for in your appeal and that the rules you were banned for have changed, and our bot mods will get it taken care of as soon as they have the time. 

Keep in mind, the appeal process sometimes takes weeks, and we expect a massive influx of appeals after this. If you have DMs open with Dank Memer, you will receive a message letting you know you've been unblacklisted. You will not receive anything if your appeal is denied, which is possible if you are not kind or if you weren't blacklisted for a rule that has changed

These will not be the only changes to the bot's rules in the coming years, and we hope to keep adapting as things change on Discord. Thank you.
