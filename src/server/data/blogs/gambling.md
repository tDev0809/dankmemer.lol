I'm going to keep this blog very short.

I realize this update to gambling may not land well with those who identify as "gamblers" primarily.

Here's the issue. There's no doubt that gambling was broken. That wasn't your fault; it was ours. Multipliers should never have been applied to gambling commands in the first place and definitely shouldn't have had the multi increased a few months ago.

That said, it needed to change. Sooner than later. If anything, this update is coming months too late. Inflation from gambling commands has been TERRIBLE lately.

I've had multiple people, myself included, start from nothing (a fresh account) and get Pepe trophies in a matter of days. This easy form of money is not intended and takes away any form of longevity in the bot.

We decided to altogether remove (secret) multis from slots and bet to save the bot long term from MASSIVE further inflation. If this went on much longer, we might have been talking about a currency wipe also.

However, through these changes, I think a few things can be achieved. Slots can pay out much more than before for one, but you have to get lucky. Bet is still a decent way to make money, but it's smaller amounts rather than MASSIVE duplicating amounts.

Slots and gamble were putting almost a billion coins per day into the currency system on their own. While people may say they were rigged, those who had millions to spend knew damn well it was the best way to MAKE money and not a true gamble.

I understand being upset at these changes, and I can't blame you. The new way to make the best money is to use other commands (which have been heavily buffed, in some cases by 800%+). Gambling commands are now just a risky way to make more money and have fun. The new item for bet can even put your odds above 50% to win if you're lucky.

We will be monitoring the net total of these two commands and making sure they're not underperforming. If they are, we'll buff the slots table and add some more base multi to bet. We'll wait and see what the data shows. Ideally, the data will show it being net even after this. Some people should lose money; it's gambling. But some people will gain a lot.

Thank you for reading this, and happy gaming, friends.
